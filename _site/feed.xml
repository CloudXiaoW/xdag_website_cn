      <content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2018/07/12/gpu-miner-v030-release.html">Our core developer Evgeniy has released an update to his XDAG GPU Miner. It now supports worker names and comes with a Mac OS version! Full change list can be found below.


  XDAG GPU Miner v0.3.0 release
  Github


Change list:

  New option -w &amp;lt;WORKER_NAME&amp;gt; - allows to set names for your rigs. Compatible only with XDAG 0.2.5. Do not use this option with pools version 0.2.4 and lower. Miner will be disconnected.
  Miner tries to restart GPUs in case of errors.
  In case of some GPU stopped - miner will not longer constantly print the last known hashrate value.
  You can configure -nvidia-fix parameter now: -nvidia-fix N, N can an integer from 5 to 95. Default value is 90. This parameter is intended to decrease CPU usage on computers with Nvidia GPUs. If the parameter is specified, logic of miner calculates how much time GPU spends on each range of nonces and switches current thread to the sleeping state for some part of the time. Sleeping for 90% of time could cause decresing of hashrate, so now you can configure the parameter yourself. But the less the time of sleeping - the more CPU usage.
  New parameter -vectors - enables OpenCL vector operations. On some GPUs it can increase performance, on some - decrease.
  Version for Mac OS.
  Optional fee 1%. You can disable fee with option -no-fee.</content><author>

  XDAG v0.2.5 release
  Github
  BitcoinTalk


Change list:

  Increased performance of loading of storage folder and synchronisation between pools (up to 100%).
  Worker names. Now it is possible to mark your rigs with names and track them. New version of Dagger Gpu Miner (v0.3.0) supports that feature.
  Hashrate for miners is calculated by pool.
  It is not necessary to specify pool address to start a wallet. You can start executable file without any parameters and wallet will automatically connect to any available pool.
  CPU-mining is removed from GUI-wallet.
  Order of transactions returned by block command is changed. The newest transactions are shown first now
  New and change pool parameters and command:
    
      mainblocks N command - returns list of newest main blocks with some additional information
      minedblocks N command - returns list of last main blocks mined by current pool
      lastblocks command is marked as obsolete and will be removed in xdag v0.3.1
      miner &amp;lt;ADDRESS&amp;gt; command - prints detailed information about specified miner
      -dm startup option - makes it possible to disable mining at all on the current pool. Disables generating new blocks each 64 seconds and pool is not available for connections for miners. This option is necessary for block explorer.

Due to the recent events the following recommendations and decisions have been made by the community and developer team.

Only use pools listed in the whitelist. Even though it’s very restraining in its current state, using only approved pools is vital for the health of the network. For now, every submission regarding whitelist addition will be audited, and only one pool will be added to whitelist per week. This will continue until the network is fully stable. The following requirements have to be fulfilled in order to apply for a pool:


  No private pools
  A public frontend would be appreciated. If you don’t want to add one, please provide at least:
    
      Pool state must be exposed in real time (maximum interval time: one minute) by HTTP.
      Pool stats must be exposed in real time (maximum interval time: one minute) by HTTP.
      Pool net conn must be exposed in real time (maximum interval time: one minute) by HTTP.
    
  
  Server time zone must be set to UTC time zone.
  Must use ntpdate to synchronize time.
  Must use root or unlimited user (max open files limit set to more then 4096) to start pool process.
  Do not try to change the hardcode of max miners.
  Server configuration with 8-core CPU, 32G RAM, SSD raid0/raid10 and above.
  1Gbit/s Internet Speed and above.
  Do not block other pools to synchronize.
  The contact person of a pool must be added to the Discord poolowner group.


Regarding whitelist additions, please send your requests to: pool@xdag.io. No other ways will be accepted for now.
In your email request, please include this list and fill out everything.


  
    1 Pool IP:
    2 Pool Configuration:
      
        2.1 Pool config:

  XDag v0.2.2 release
  Github


Change list:

  Transaction address is shown in the console version, you can track the status of your transaction in the block explorer.
  New field “State” was added to the output of the “block” command. See description below.
  A bug in DNET which could break synchronization between pools is fixed.
  A bug in block validation logic which could lead to divergence of balances between pools is fixed.
  Large changes to mining:
    
      Unpaid shares are paid even if miner is disconnected.
      Miners who use several rigs with one wallet address recieve only one total payment, not several payments corresponding to the number of connections. It should help to decrease network load.
      Restriction on count of connections with the same address was added. This count can be configured, see description below.
      Count of shares per task from one connection was restricted to 20, if count of shares exceeds 20 (during one minute) miner is disconnected. It was made with the purpose to protect pool againnst DDOS and cheating with shares.
      If you use several connections with the same address you can no longer send the same shares. All shares must be unique.
      Output of the miners command was changed. See description below.
      Max count of connections was increased to 8192.
    
  
  Small update in the GUI wallet.
  Draft version of JSON-RPC. Not ready for exchanges at the moment.
  Some log messages are disabled during the loading process of the storage. It can help to decrease count of disk I/O operations and speed up the loading of storage folder.
  DAG takes too much space in memory. Pools use temporary files for swapping in order to decrease memory usage. A new configuration “-z” was added:
    
      -z   - you can set path to temp-file folder.
      -z RAM - use RAM instead of temp-files. It can speed up loading of storage and make the pool faster, but demands large amout of free memory.
    
  


Transaction address:
After a transfer, you will see this message, “Transaction address is xxxxxxxxxxxxxx, it will take several minutes to complete the transaction.”. Example:

xdag&amp;gt; xfer 5 EnTkFVTGB+J4oKHHTQIay3Q3Zc1a8s0u
Password:
Xfer: transferred 5.000000000 XDAG to the address EnTkFVTGB+J4oKHHTQIay3Q3Zc1a8s0u.
Transaction address is ksk5SsT5PqLhAwCUhqtBFNPB6WizsDk0, it will take several minutes to complete the transaction.

You can use that address to track your transaction, for example: https://explorer.xdag.io/block/ksk5SsT5PqLhAwCUhqtBFNPB6WizsDk0

Currently you can use field “Flags” to find out the state of the transaction (block):
0 - block is just recieved.
10 - block is in processing.
1c - block is accepted.
1F - it is main block.
18 - block is rejected. It can be caused by insufficient balance or synchronization problems.

New version has a new field “state” with the following values:

  Pending
  Accepted
  Rejected
  Main


Example:
xdag&amp;gt; block  gkileoNyIQ+24I82gBKXcsm1wZSKHIVd

Existing block explorers can use this field to show the block state.

For pool owners: The configuration for pool was updated. A new parameter “maxconn - maximum allowed number of miners with the same address” was added. Also parameters were reordered.

-P ip:port:CFG - run the pool, bind to ip:port, CFG is miners:maxip:maxconn:fee:reward:direct:fund
                     miners - maximum allowed number of miners,
                     maxip - maximum allowed number of miners connected from single ip,
                     maxconn - maximum allowed number of miners with the same address,
                     fee - pool fee in percent,
                     reward - reward to miner who got a block in percent,
                     direct - reward to miners participated in earned block in percent,
                     fund - community fund fee in percent


Example of command line for starting pool (for test net):
xdag -t -p 213.21.5.18:3366 -P 213.21.5.18:454:1000:100:60:1:1:1:1


Output of miners command was changed. Example:

Now all connections with the same address are grouped. Disconnected miners are marked with “archived” state. Archive miners are removed from the list when all shares are paid. In order to see the list in the old format, you can use command “miners conn.”

Due to the recent events the following recommendations and decisions have been made by the community and developer team.

Only use pools listed in the whitelist. Even though it’s very restraining in its current state, using only approved pools is vital for the health of the network.
For now, every submission regarding whitelist addition will be audited. This will continue until the network is fully stable.
The following requirements have to be fulfilled in order to apply for a pool:


  No private pools
  A public frontend would be appreciated. If you don’t want to add one, please provide at least:
    
      Pool status must be exposed in real time (maximum interval time: one minute) by HTTP
      Pool net conn must be exposed in real time (maximum interval time: one minute) by HTTP
    
  
  Server time zone must be set to UTC time zone
  Must use ntpdate to synchronize time
  Must use root or unlimited user (max open files limit set to more then 4096) to start pool process
  Do not try to change the hardcode of max miners
  Server configuration with 8-core CPU, 32G RAM, SSD raid0/raid10 and above
  1Gbit/s Internet Speed and above


The contact person of a pool must be added to the Discord poolowner group.

Regarding whitelist additions, please send your requests to: pool@xdag.io. No other ways will be accepted for now.

In your email request, please include this list and fill out everything.
